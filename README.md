 # Pre-work - Tippr
 Tip Calculator app for iOS created using Xcode
 
Submitted by: John Ajao

Time spent: 5 hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [✓] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [✓] User can select between tip percentages by tapping different values on the stepper control and text field and the tip value is updated accordingly

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [✓] UI animations
* [✓] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [✓] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [✓] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [✓] User can set a default tip value for the app to have on startup
- [✓] User can switch main screen between dark mode and light mode

## Notes

-Learning the different types of action each UI element can have
-Not knowing how to change elements of a storyboard through another storyboard
